## Principles of Law
1. Justice
3. Freedom

**Justice** is the objective of Law
Justice is the fundamental principle to which all rulings must conform. Justice is the absolute axiom. Justice is hereby defined as the equal, impartial and reasonable treatment of parties.

**Freedom** is a given
Man has the right to live free from coercion.

**Minimality**
Text lends to infinite interpretation, therefore law must be minimal to avoid misunderstandings.

**Consent**
Consent is essential to rule of law. Without consent comes arbitrary rule. Non consenting parties are slaves to those who rule without it. 

**Positive Dualism**
Law gives rights, not prohibitions. Prohibitions are implied by the negation of rights. 

*Man* is hereby defined as all living human beings. Man, woman, or child.
