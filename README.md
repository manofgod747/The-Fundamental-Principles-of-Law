### Justice - The objective of Law
Justice is the fundamental principle to which all rulings must conform. Justice is the absolute axiom. Justice is hereby defined as the equal, impartial and reasonable treatment of parties.

### Independence
The independence of the legal system is crucial. Any reasonable legal system is independent of all other system. Be it the state or something else. This means that the parties–judge, jury, and executioner–are elected in democratic processes in opposition to being seated by the political class. To ensure an independent legal system, all legal officials must be elected by the people. Be it judge, jury, or executioner (police).

### Freedom - Is a given
Man has the right to live free from coercion.

### Equality
Everyone is equal in face of the law. Law does not define special groups or interests. 

### Minimality
Text lends to infinite interpretation, therefore law must be minimal to avoid misunderstandings.

### Consent
Consent is essential to rule of law. Without consent comes arbitrary rule. Non consenting parties are slaves to those who rule without it. Consent requires understanding. Understanding requires simplicity.

### Positive Dualism
Law gives rights, not prohibitions. Prohibitions are implied by the negation of rights.

## Appendix

### Justice and Reason
Without justice and reason as the foundational principle of the legal system, all legal proceeding have arbitrary outcomes. Justice means that the parties of a trial agree that the verdict is fair and impartial. Fairness and impartialness can only be achieved if the reason for a verdict is based on sound moral and logical grounds. 

### Life Begins at Conception
Life is sacred. The soul lives and feels independent of bodily development. Therefore abortion is considered premeditated murder.

### Equal Access to Information
Individuals in cooperation have the right to equal information access. If not, moral judgement is impossible and the individuals who lack information may unknowingly aid in criminal activity. 

Individuals in conflict need equal access to information or the party with less information lacks the means to investigate wrong doing.

Equal information access incentivises good leadership.


### The Right too Choose Judge
In order to have safe and trustworthy legal proceedings, each man must have the right to choose his judge from the pool of available candidates. The parties of a legal proceeding can only trust the verdict if they have a chance to themselfes judge the moral character of the appointed judge. When judges are appointed arbitrarily, the parties are forced to trust–or rather mistrust–the legal process, and the results of a proceeding are as arbitrary as the legal system itself. 

### Death
To protect life it is necessary to acknowledge death. 
* Man has the right to choose death.
* Death is a necessary punishment for those who do not respect the right to free life, when rehabilitation is impossible, and exile is insufficient.
