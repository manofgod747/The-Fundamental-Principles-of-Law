This document serves as a candidate to national law that upholds the principles of justice, freedom, equality, minimality, consent and positive dualism.

## Glossary
**Man** - All living human beings. Man, woman, or child.

## Principles of Law
1. Justice
3. Freedom
4. Equality
6. Minimality
7. Consent
8. Positive Dualism

### Justice - The objective of Law
Justice is the fundamental principle to which all rulings must conform. Justice is the absolute axiom. Justice is hereby defined as the equal, impartial and reasonable treatment of parties.

### Freedom - Is a given
Man has the right to live free from coercion.

### Equality
Everyone is equal under the rule of law. Law does not define special groups or interests. 

### Minimality
Text lends to infinite interpretation, therefore law must be minimal to avoid misunderstandings.

### Consent
Consent is essential to rule of law. Without consent comes arbitrary rule. Non consenting parties are slaves to those who rule without it. 

### Positive Dualism
Law gives rights, not prohibitions. Prohibitions are implied by the negation of rights.

Life is sacred. The soul lives and feels independent of bodily development. Therefore abortions are considered premeditated murder.

* Death is a necessary punishment for those who do not respect the right to free life, when rehabilitation is impossible, and exile is insufficient.
